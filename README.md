# Introduction

This is a simple blog website that allows users to create blogs using the mern stack and supabase.
If the website doesn't work then the backend server is most likely offline due to it being hosted on a free service

# How to run
First in the backend folder create an env file with the key: MONGO_URI and provide it a valid MONGODB URI to a mongoDB database.
It will also require a supabase bucket.

Then run npm install on both backend and frontend folders.

Afterwards run npm run dev command on both the backend and frontend folders to start the program.
